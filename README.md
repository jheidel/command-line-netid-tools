command-line-netid-tools
========================

Command line scrips for resolving between names and netids.
Will break if people search is ever changed.

Scripts:
name2netid resolves names to netids.
netid2name resolves a netid to a name.

table.py allows for table rendering.

Put these scripts in your path for best effect.
